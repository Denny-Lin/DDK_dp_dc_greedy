# DDK_dp_dc_greedy
It is a repo to record the algorithms of dynamic programming, divide and conquer, greed.

# Let us start
* The first dynamic programming that we can learn is Fibonacci Numbers.
* dp[n]=dp[n-1]+dp[n-2];
* The second dynamic programming that we can learn is climbing stairs.
* dp[n]=dp[n-1]+dp[n-2];
* As you can see all prblem can be solved by small problem which was recorded.
* ...
