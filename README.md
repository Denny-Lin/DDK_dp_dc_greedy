# DDK_dp_dc_greedy
It is a repo to record the algorithms of dynamic programming, divide and conquer, greed.

# Let us start with the dynamic programming
* The first dynamic programming that we can learn is Fibonacci Numbers.
* dp[n]=dp[n-1]+dp[n-2];
* The second dynamic programming that we can learn is climbing stairs.
* dp[n]=dp[n-1]+dp[n-2];
* As you can see, all prblem can be solved by small problem which was recorded.
* All the dp problem can be soved by using two methods of 1. recursive with table in stack and 2. iteration with table from the initial numbers.
* ...

# Let us talk about the divide and conquer
* The first divide and conquer that we can learn is quick sort. 
* The second divide and conquer that we can learn is merge sort. 
* both sortings are not dynamic programming, because they don't have the overlapping subproblems.
